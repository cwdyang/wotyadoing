<mark>[Slide 1]</mark>: 
Thankyou. It is no surprise that western populations are getting older. In New Zealand 585,000 people are over the age of 65. This figure is still growing. By 2031 21% of all New Zealanders will be over 65. The leading cause of Death for those over 65 are fall-related incidents. 30% of sensiors will have at least one fall each year. That's at least 193,000 falls each year! Falls are a massive cost on health care systems across the world. 

<mark>[Slide 2]</mark> Of those falls, 50% of all seniors need someone else's help. By responding within one hour, 90% of all seniors that have a fall will recover and continue to live independently. However 30% of all seniors that fall are on the floor for over an hour.

Timely Medical Attention Saves Lives.

So what is the solution? 

Ladies and Gentlemen, today I am pleased to announce the solution: <mark>[Slide 3]</mark> Sentricare! When you can't be there; there's Sentricare. 

Sentricare's 24x7 service provides <mark>[Slide 4]</mark> peace of mind for seniors and their families. Unlike other fall detection systems that require expensive sensors installed in your house: <mark>[Slide 5]</mark> Sentricare goes where you go. The system notifies the response centre, but also <mark>[Slide 6]</mark> loved ones via SMS and Social Media connections. 

<mark>[Slide 7]</mark> Incidents not only include fall detection, but other important safety features such as an emergency button and gas leak detection. <mark>[Slide 8]</mark> Rapid response means emergency services can be with you sooner. <mark>[Slide 9]</mark> Wherever you go, Sentricare is with you. 

<mark>[Slide 10]</mark> The most important factor taking Sentricare beyond the everyday is the innovative use of cloud technology to provide insight. By answering these questions, carers, senior services and clinicians have a powerful tool to improve quality of life for our older citizens. <mark>[Slide 11]</mark> Ultimately, Sentricare is about prevention. By identifying hazards in the home and public spaces through mapping and data analysis, risks can be mitigated. 

<mark>[Slide 11]</mark>Prevention is better and cheaper than the cure. Currently St John's Lifelink product is available for $45 per month with a setup cost of $350 and can only be used within 300m of the house. <mark>[Slide 12]</mark> Sentricare goes wherever you do: At $199 per device, and $44 per month; Sentricare is the more cost-effecitve solution.

<mark>[Slide 13]</mark> Sentricare is the smart choice. Sentricare is the Safe choice.

<mark>[Slide 14]</mark> Thankyou. Now we will demonstrate the Sentricare solution and I will hand over to Sean.

Ladies and Gentlemen, today we are very excited to present Sentricare. W

* Did you know that falls are the leading cause of injuries in people over 65? 
* Our loves ones over 75 are 4 times more likely to have a fall related injury than at age 65. 
* Falls are the single largest cause of death in New Zealand for people over 65. 1 in 3 seniors over 65 experiences a fall each year.
* Women are two times more likely to suffer a fracture than men. 
* 50% of seniors who fall need assistance from someone else. 
* 90% of all seniors who receive assistance within the first hour can continue to live independently but 
* 30% of all seniors are on the floor for more than an hour. 
* with 1/3 will experience a fall at least once a year.
* Western populations are living longer. 
* Currently in Australia there are 5 working adults to every pensioner. By 2030, it is projected to be 1 in 3. 
* In New Zealand, 21% of the population will be over 65 by 2031. 

This is a massive cost on health care systems across the world. WOur older loves ones deserve to live in a safe, secure and dignified way. The investment in Sentricare is a mere fraction of the cost of falls to our society.

Timely Medical Attention Saves lives. 

Sentricare's 24x7 service provides peace of mind for seniors and their families. Unlike other fall detection systems that require expensive sensors installed in your house: Sentricare goes where you go. The system notifies the response centre, but also loved ones via SMS and Social Media connections. 

This however is not where Sentricare ends: Our cloud service provides insights that allow us to take preventative action to make homes safer: Our analytics indicate when a safety assessment is necessary: Not just in the home, but in public spaces. 

Sentricare is Ever Present. Safe.

###Demo
<mark>Demo has **four** minutes</mark>

**Narrator - Part 1: Device and App**

Sentricare is there when you need it most. Here is the sentricare belt, or as we refer to it: the halo of safety. This one small convenient device is worn by the older person. This device works in tandem with the Sentricare mobile app. Unlike other fall prevention devices, Sentricare's big advantage is that it is not bound to the home: it goes wherever you go, providing a safety net wherever and whenever you need it. 

*Demo - device and app*

1. Model shows off the Sentricare device - standing in front of audience wearing the belt
2. Model shows the mobile app    

**Narrator - Part 2: Falling Down**

We can't be everywhere all the time which is why Sentricare is there when you need it most. A small fall can lead to big problems, and a quick effective response is necessary. A fifteen second warning is sounded allowing the user to cancel if it was a small stumble before triggering an alert.

*Demo - falling down*

1. Model walks across stage and has a fall
2. Alert Button is triggered

**Narrator - Part 3: Panic Button**

It's important that when you have a problem, you have someone ready to support you. Sentricare's Alert Button let's someone know when you need help. It's as simple as pushing a button. No dialling numbers:

*Demo - Panic Button*

1. Model says - "Oh no, I don't feel well!"
2. Press the Panic Button

**Narrator - Part 4: Gas Leak**

It only takes one forgetful moment to create a dangerous situation. Sentricare's gas leak detector creates an alert immediately. As you can see, it can detect leaks and immediately alert the user and transmit a message to Sentricare operators.

*Demo - gas leak*

1. Assistant comes up with butane - sprays in front of model.
2. Alert is sounded

**Narrator - Part 5: Operator**

So we've talked about the user aspect of Sentricare, but to take it beyond the everyday, Sentricare's cloud-based alert and action system allows subscribers and operators to monitor and manage incidents.

*Demo - manage alerts*

1. Assistant 1 - "I am an operator, looking monitoring activity"
2. Assistant 2 - "I've am out of town. I'll just check to how Nanna is going."

##Slide 9 - Insight
Sentricare answers many important questions: Who is having falls? Where are they located? What is the frequency of alerts and warnings?

The most important factor taking Sentricare beyond the everyday is the innovative use of cloud technology to provide insight. By answering these questions, carers, senior services and clinicians have a powerful tool to improve quality of life for our older citizens.
