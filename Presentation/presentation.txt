Ladies and Gentlemen, today we are very excited to present Sentricare. W

* Did you know that falls are the leading cause of injuries in people over 65? 
* Our loves ones over 75 are 4 times more likely to have a fall related injury than at age 65. 
* Falls are the single largest cause of death in New Zealand for people over 65. 1 in 3 seniors over 65 experiences a fall each year.
* Women are two times more likely to suffer a fracture than men. 
* 50% of seniors who fall need assistance from someone else. 
* 90% of all seniors who receive assistance within the first hour can continue to live independently but 
* 30% of all seniors are on the floor for more than an hour. 
* with 1/3 will experience a fall at least once a year.
* Western populations are living longer. 
* Currently in Australia there are 5 working adults to every pensioner. By 2030, it is projected to be 1 in 3. 
* In New Zealand, 21% of the population will be over 65 by 2031. 

This is a massive cost on health care systems across the world. WOur older loves ones deserve to live in a safe, secure and dignified way. The investment in Sentricare is a mere fraction of the cost of falls to our society.

Timely Medical Attention Saves lives. 

Sentricare's 24x7 service provides peace of mind for seniors and their families. Unlike other fall detection systems that require expensive sensors installed in your house: Sentricare goes where you go. The system notifies the response centre, but also loved ones via SMS and Social Media connections. 

This however is not where Sentricare ends: Our cloud service provides insights that allow us to take preventative action to make homes safer: Our analytics indicate when a safety assessment is necessary: Not just in the home, but in public spaces. 

Sentricare is Ever Present. Safe.

Sentricare answers many important questions: Who is having falls? Where are they located? What is the frequency of alerts and warnings?

The most important factor taking Sentricare beyond the everyday is the innovative use of cloud technology to provide insight. By answering these questions, carers, senior services and clinicians have a powerful tool to improve quality of life for our older citizens.

Here at Sentricare, we've undertaken diligent research to implement the most accurate proprietary fall-sensing algorithm. 

The device includes features such as: warning notification when the user has fallen, given them to opportunity to cancel the alert within a set period of time. This may come about when the person has fallen but is conscious, and they may feel okay, but this does not prevent a notification from being sent to the Sentricare service. 

Another feature is the panic button, our user can activate the panic button, and a notification is sent to Sentricare service. 

Another key feature, Sentricare is there when you need it most. Here is the Sentricare belt, or as we refer to it: the halo of safety. This one small convenient device is worn by the older person. This device works in tandem with the Sentricare mobile app. Unlike other fall prevention devices, Sentricare's big advantage is that it is not bound to the home: it goes wherever you go, providing a safety net wherever and whenever you need it.
