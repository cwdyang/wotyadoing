Ladies and Gentlemen, today we are very excited to present Sentricare. W

* Did you know that falls are the leading cause of injuries in people over 65? 
* Our loves ones over 75 are 4 times more likely to have a fall related injury than at age 65. 
* Falls are the single largest cause of death in New Zealand for people over 65. 1 in 3 seniors over 65 experiences a fall each year.
* Women are two times more likely to suffer a fracture than men. 
* 50% of seniors who fall need assistance from someone else. 
* 90% of all seniors who receive assistance within the first hour can continue to live independently but 
* 30% of all seniors are on the floor for more than an hour. 
* with 1/3 will experience a fall at least once a year.
* Western populations are living longer. 
* Currently in Australia there are 5 working adults to every pensioner. By 2030, it is projected to be 1 in 3. 
* In New Zealand, 21% of the population will be over 65 by 2031. 

This is a massive cost on health care systems across the world. WOur older loves ones deserve to live in a safe, secure and dignified way. The investment in Sentricare is a mere fraction of the cost of falls to our society.

Timely Medical Attention Saves lives. 

Sentricare's 24x7 service provides peace of mind for seniors and their families. Unlike other fall detection systems that require expensive sensors installed in your house: Sentricare goes where you go. The system notifies the response centre, but also loved ones via SMS and Social Media connections. 

This however is not where Sentricare ends: Our cloud service provides insights that allow us to take preventative action to make homes safer: Our analytics indicate when a safety assessment is necessary: Not just in the home, but in public spaces. 

Sentricare is Ever Present. Safe.
